# JKOS

JK operating system.

## About

Wanted to improve my bare-metal skills, so why not make a whole operating system?

## Building and running

### Requirements

- nasm
- qemu-system-x86
- make

After installing the prerequisites, just run ```./run.sh```, which should build the binary and run qemu.
